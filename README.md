# DakotaCastle-RayShivelyProject
Unity Project for CSC 140 that I, Dakota Castle, and my teammate Ray Shively worked on for the semester. 

Code written in C# and intended to use in Unity 2022.3.8f1

In order to implement frame data into our fighting game, we utilized animation events to determine when an attack is in startup, active, or ending frames.

This was a group project, so credit goes to Ray Shively for helping plan and write this code.
